hi
The Fitness Tracker Website whould be able to track the fitness of the customer based on the food he takes and the workout he does.

The home Page of the website would have a hyperlink to the food page and the exercise page.

The food page should show all the food he takes and the number of calories he would get for each food 

The exercise page should show what type of machine he is working on and the number of calories he would burn for a paticular amount of time and the duration for which he does the workout each time.
